# Main features

I have created my own library for a project, a footer that I have uploaded to npm. The usage instructions are in the npm readme.

I created it using the following commands:

ng new MyDaniFooter --create-application=false

cd MyDaniFooter

ng generate mydany-footer to generate the library

I added the HTML and CSS code in mydani-footer.component.ts

I configured it in the package.json file and remembered to update the version number each time I made changes.

I ran ng build to build the library and accessed it in its dist folder.

I logged into npm using npm login and ran npm publish to publish it.

npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/mydani-footer?activeTab=readme

git npm https://github.com/danideveloperweb/MYDANIFOOTER

A package has been installed for translation and two JSON files have been created where the two languages to be translated are located. It is a web with routing to navigate between different components. In this case, the detail has been implemented through the ID that enters a specific player
